# PlanIT  

This is a simple **Task Manager** application built with **React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS**. The app allows users to add, edit, complete, and delete tasks while categorizing them into different tabs based on their due dates and completion status.

## 🚀 Features  

✅ Add new or Edit tasks with details like:  
  - Task name  
  - Due date  
  - Tags (comma-separated)  
  - Urgency (Urgent / Not Urgent)  
  - Importance (Important / Not Important)  

✅ Mark tasks as **Completed / Uncompleted**  

✅ Delete tasks  

✅ Categorized tabs:  
  - **Inbox** → Shows all uncompleted tasks  
  - **Today** → Displays tasks due today  
  - **Missed** → Shows past due (uncompleted) tasks  
  - **Completed** → Displays all completed tasks  

✅ Tasks are **stored in localStorage**, so they persist between page reloads
